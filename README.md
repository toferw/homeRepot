# homeRepot
These are scripts I use to place my home directory under revision control. They are based off of the ideas proposed on https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754

The createHomeRepot.sh script is only used if you are starting without a repo of your home driectory already created.

The homeRepot.sh script is used to pull your home directory down from a repo onto a computer that is not already set up. It takes the address of the repo as a command line argument.
